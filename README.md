## Flicks — Cinema Together UI Concepts

This repo contains the **interactive UI concepts** for Flicks’ *Cinema Together* initiative: a nine-screen React prototype that turns solitary showtime browsing into a **social, coordinated cinema ritual**.

These screens are designed as a **hire-ready artifact** for Vista Group: they demonstrate not just visual depth and motion craft, but also **interaction design, state modelling, and engineering quality** at the level you would ship inside a production app.

---

## What’s in this repo

- **`ui-concept/`**  
  A React 19 + Vite app that renders all nine Cinema Together screens inside an iPhone 15 Pro frame:
  - **Feature 1 — Social Signals**: friend interest on films and sessions
  - **Feature 2 — Who’s In**: invite, RSVP, and coordination flows
  - **Feature 3 — Quick Capture**: post-film reactions and diary

The gallery at the root of the app presents all screens as **animated cover cards** you can click to step into a phone-frame viewer with previous/next navigation.

You can run everything locally (see **Running the prototype** below).

---

## Why this matters for Vista Group

- **Connects discovery to attendance.** Flicks is already strong on “what & where to watch”. These concepts show **how to own the social coordination in the middle** — who is going, when, and with whom.
- **Turns friend intent into measurable revenue.** Social signals and RSVP flows are designed to **multiply ticket yield per intent signal**, not just capture solo bookings.
- **Provides a human, consumer-facing layer on top of Vista’s stack.** The flows are intentionally “thin”: they assume Vista Cloud, Movio and React survey products exist, and they **surface them through a delightful consumer UI**.
- **Demonstrates craft as well as systems thinking.** Every screen is tuned for **gestalt, animation, and micro-interactions**, not just information architecture. This is as much a design-craft artifact as it is a product/system artifact.

For the full strategic narrative, market analysis, and Vista flywheel, see the **separate strategy case study repo** (this repo stays focused on the UI concepts themselves).

## Feature overview — Cinema Together

### Feature 1 — Social Signals

Make it obvious when a film is “alive” with friend intent, without turning the app into a social feed.

- **1A — Showtimes with Social Signals**  
  Showtimes page for a single film:
  - Horizontal **date picker** and **cinema listings** with session pills.
  - Session pills highlight where friends are going; avatars appear below times.
  - A **Social Signal banner** surfaces “N friends want to see this” with a Join CTA.
  - Tapping sessions where friends are going takes you to a consolidated **Friends’ Sessions** view.

- **1B — Film Detail with Social Proof** (`FilmDetailSocialScreen`)  
  A hero-first film detail screen that:
  - Uses an expanded **backdrop hero** plus poster + RT/audience scores.
  - Surfaces a **“Friends interested”** section: avatars, statuses (Going / Interested / Watchlisted), and a compact social summary about who wants to see it.
  - Keeps showtimes out of the way (one “View Showtimes” CTA) so this screen reads as **film detail**, not another showtimes grid.

- **1C — Friends’ Sessions** (`FriendsSessionsScreen`)  
  A **stacked, date-grouped list** of every session your friends are attending this week:
  - Each card shows date, time, cinema, format (VMAX / Gold Class), avatars, and names.
  - Gold **Join** pills per session with a subtle joined state (check + “Joined”).
  - Designed to answer: *“Sarah, Tom, and Marcus are going — when and where exactly?”* at a glance.

### Feature 2 — Who’s In?

Turn a showtime selection into a lightweight group coordination flow — without turning Flicks into a heavy event planner.

- **2A — Booking / Seat Map Concept** (`BookingScreen`)  
  A single, high-fidelity **seat selection concept**:
  - 8x12 auditorium layout with **friend seats highlighted** (Sarah & Tom), suggested seats pulsing nearby, and selected seats in Flicks red.
  - Ticket count stepper, price summary, and a **Confirm Booking** CTA.
  - On confirm, a success state transitions you toward the RSVP tracker.

- **2B — Invite Friends (from contacts)** (`InviteFriendsScreen`)  
  When you pick a showtime with **no friends going yet**:
  - Session context card at the top clarifies *what* you’re inviting to.
  - Searchable list of **phone contacts** with invite toggles.
  - “Send Invite(s)” CTA with a confirmation state that conceptually flows into the RSVP view.

- **2C — Who’s In? RSVP Tracker** (`WhosInTrackerScreen`)  
  A clean **dashboard for a single session**:
  - Blurred hero with film, time, cinema, and “N confirmed · M awaiting”.
  - Avatar row of confirmed friends plus `+ Invite` pill that opens a bottom sheet.
  - RSVP list with **status badges** (Going, Maybe, Invited, Declined) and a subtle “Reminder sent” micro-interaction when you tap an Invited row.
  - No unnecessary share/export clutter; the focus is on who’s actually in.

### Feature 3 — Quick Capture

Capture how screenings felt, not just that they happened — and feed that data back into recommendations and social signals.

- **3A — Lock Screen Notification** (`NotificationPreview`)  
  iOS-style notification shown 2h after a showtime:
  - “How was Conclave?” with poster, static 4/5 star hint, and **Rate it / Later** actions.
  - Tightly matched to iOS affordances (status bar, time, date, home indicator).

- **3B — Emoji-first Reaction + Rating Sheet**  
  Bottom sheet attached to 3A:
  - Emoji-first selection (Loved it, Liked it, It was ok, Boring, Hated it) that auto-sets a star rating.
  - Editable 1–5 star control and optional note field.
  - “Save to diary” CTA that flows directly into 3C.

- **3C — Viewing Diary** (`DiaryScreen`)  
  A **personal viewing log**:
  - Stats row (“3 films · 4.1 avg rating · 2 with friends”).
  - Recent entries as **diary cards**: poster, date, cinema, emoji, star rating, note, and friend stack.
  - A single “Export all to Letterboxd” action lives here (not on the RSVP or booking flows).

## Running the prototype

```bash
cd ui-concept
npm install
npm run dev
```

- The app boots at `http://localhost:5173` (or the next available port).
- The **gallery view** is the default: hover the cover cards to see motion, click any card to open the corresponding screen in the phone frame.
- Use the **prev/next arrows** or “All screens” to navigate between concepts.

For a production-like build:

```bash
cd ui-concept
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Architecture & engineering notes

- **Entry point**: `ui-concept/src/App.tsx`  
  Uses React Router to route between a **gallery page** and a **screen viewer layout**.

- **Screen viewer**: `ScreenViewerLayout.tsx`  
  - Renders a 393×852 `PhoneFrame` (iPhone 15 Pro logical size) with a dynamic island.
  - Drives a `SCREENS` registry (IDs `1a–3c`) so cards, routes, and descriptions stay in sync.

- **Feature screens**:  
  - `FilmDetailScreen.tsx` — Showtimes + social signals (1A).
  - `FilmDetailSocialScreen.tsx` — Film detail + social proof (1B).
  - `FriendsSessionsScreen.tsx` — Friend sessions list (1C).
  - `BookingScreen.tsx` — Seat selection concept (2A).
  - `InviteFriendsScreen.tsx` — Contact-based invite flow (2B).
  - `WhosInTrackerScreen.tsx` — RSVP dashboard (2C).
  - `NotificationPreview.tsx` + `DiaryScreen.tsx` — Quick Capture flows (3A–3C).

- **Design system & components**:  
  - `components/layout/PhoneFrame.tsx` — device chrome, dynamic island, shadow.
  - `components/layout/StatusBar.tsx` — iOS-like status bar (light/dark).
  - `components/flicks/*` — extracted Flicks primitives (tabs, date picker, showtime pills, film hero, etc.).
  - `components/cinema-together/*` — new social feature primitives (GoldButton, GoldCheckbox, SocialSignalBadge, FriendRow, RSVPBadge, BottomSheet, ViewingDiaryCard, EmojiReactionPill, etc.).

- **Data**: all mock data is local (`data.ts`, `data/mockData.ts`) — no API calls.

## Relationship to the strategy case study

This repo is intentionally **UI-only**. It is the interactive front-end that comes out of a much deeper product strategy project:

- Market sizing and cinema attendance trends
- Competitive landscape (Fandango, Atom, Letterboxd, JustWatch, IMDb, current Flicks)
- Vista Group flywheel (Vista Cloud, Movio, React, Horizon)
- Research on what actually drives people to go to the cinema (and with whom)

Those materials — including the long-form **“From Discovery to Ritual”** essay — are housed in a **separate case study repo** so this project can stay focused on the craft and interaction design of the UI.

If you’re evaluating this work for a role or partnership, the recommended reading order is:

1. **Skim this repo** and click through the nine screens to feel the flows.
2. **Read the strategy case study** (separate repo) to see how this execution ties into Vista’s commercial and product strategy.
